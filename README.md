## 🧠 Object-Oriented Concepts Used

| OOP Concept | How it’s used in CoinCart |
|------------|--------------------------|
| **Classes & Objects** | Product, Cart items, Order flow represented as components |
| **Encapsulation** | Data like price, quantity, and coin values protected within objects |
| **Inheritance** | Shared UI behaviors reused across pages/components |
| **Polymorphism** | Same functions operating differently e.g., UI button logic varies by screen |
| **Abstraction** | Users interact with simple UI while complex logic is hidden |

> Even in a low-code platform like Bolt, these OOP principles apply in component design and logic reusability.
